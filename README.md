#### Space-Kingdoms-Unity2D-Project
Unity 2D project: Unity Engine based video game written in C#.
The project is in development (early stages).

> ** Game Idea **
> The Idea of the game is to combine several game genres and technics like RPG, Platformer, Resource Management and 
> Open World Exploration (DO NOT EXPECT GTA LEVEL) for different game events with 2D graphics.
> The design, game technics and story idea may change / evolve during the developemnt, stay tuned.

> ** Story **
> Wel... The background is futuristic space. Main plot and characters is still in development.

> ** Gameplay **
> The idea is use simple existing game technics and gameplays, each for a different in-game event. For example, one 
> type of battle can be executed as RPG style battle and other type of battle can be a platformer or 
> other genre.

> ** Design **
> Probably will change. At the start I'm using very generic images and templates found in Google.

> ** First examples **
